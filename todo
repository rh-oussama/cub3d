# TODO

## 1. Improve Performance
- **Optimize 2D Map Rendering:**
  - !!!!! stop rendring if the player fixed in his place and dosent move 
  - Instead of drawing the 2D map every render, draw it only once at the beginning.
  - Do not draw the player initially.
  - Draw only the mini-map in the render, draw the player in the center and angle row.

## 2. Optimize Image Clearing
- **Reduce Frequency of Clear Image Function !DELETE IT ALL:**
  - Do not use the clear image function frequently as it consumes a lot of CPU.
  - Use it only if the image is small enough to clear.

- **Optimize 3D Floor and Ceiling Clearing:**
  - Instead of clearing the entire image, floor, and ceiling each time during rendering, do it in the draw wall function when calculating the wall height.
  - When calculating wall height, calculate the difference between the top of the wall and the ceiling, and draw it with color. Do the same for the floor (dor it tn the draw walll function).

## 3. DELETE Existing Functions
- **Delete the Following Functions in Render:**
  - `clear_image(&(data->img_3d), data->ceiling_color);`
  - `draw_floor(&(data->img_3d), data->floor_color);`
  - `clear_image(&(data->img_2d), COLOR_BLACK);`
  - `ground_draw(data);`
  - `player_draw(data);`
  - `draw_line(data);`
